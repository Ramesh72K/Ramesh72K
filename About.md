**Hi!ðŸ‘‹**
I'm Ramesh, a passionate Graduate student at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Trivandrum. Currently specializing in Thermal and Propulsion, 
I'm delving into the intricacies of designing rocket propulsion systems and the fascinating process that underlies their construction.

**Professional Background:**
In my previous role, I was a Design Engineer at MaDeIT, a tech startup incubator located at IIITDM Kanchipuram. There, I assisted early-stage startups designing and prototyping their products, facilitating their journey to secure funding. 
This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the startup ecosystem, market research, and achieving product-market fit.

**Academic Achievements:**
I completed my B.E in Aeronautical Engineering from Kumaraguru College of Technology (2017 â€“ 2021) with an 8.85 CGPA, earning a First class with Distinction!

**Research and Collaborations:**
During my undergraduate years, I dedicated my time to designing and analyzing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This journey led me to collaborate with esteemed professors and researchers, resulting in the publication of several research papers in renowned journals such as AIAA and ASME.

**Online Presence:**
I enjoy sharing my work and insights with the world through various platforms. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inramesh/) and explore my occasional content on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbQXfgTcP0tYokHwuGsNJtg).
